[Required libs to install]
1. telebot (pip install telebot in cmd)
2. sqlite3 (pip install sqlite3 or pip install sqlite in cmd)
3. requests (pip install sqlite in cmd)

Additional bash file to set up bot when something goes wrong 

If bash doesn`t work try to change 'python' to 'python3' at 8 line

To ran bash script use in command "cd BASH_SCRIPT_FOLDER" "bash BASH_SCRIPT_NAME &" (& - to run in background) to reload bot you should kill python process and it will start again

Also, you can add service to run this bash ar the start of server, but it`s individual for system

I can set up bot on vds if it needed
